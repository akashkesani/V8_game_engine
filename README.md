Game engine for 2D games


The engine has various sub-engines which deal with a certain aspect of the game - actor, physics, play, story, UI and utility. 

Within each sub-engine there is an entity and it's corresponding actions. Each entity holds the data related to a component within the game and the acion is the functonaility that can be implemented by the component. This structure follows a clear seperation of data and actions which helps in developing clean code. 

The python folder holds the exaples of how the engine can be utilised in developing a game.
